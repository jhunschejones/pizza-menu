# Pizza Menu Project
In this project, a pretend client is asking me to create an online pizza menu system. I completed the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some help from Boostrap 4. Below are the site requirements as submitted by the 'client:'
  
THE MENU WILL NEED TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING:

Radio buttons for a sauce selection:
